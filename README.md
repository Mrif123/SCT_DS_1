# India Population Distribution Analysis (2022)

This project analyzes and visualizes India's population distribution across different age groups using Python and Matplotlib. The data is based on age-wise population estimates from 2022.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Bar chart showing population by 5-year age bands.
- Line chart depicting trends in population across age groups.
- Histogram simulated from grouped data to visualize population spread across individual ages.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
  
Install dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## ðŸ§  Methodology

- The dataset contains age groups and corresponding population counts.
- A histogram is created by simulating individual ages using `numpy.random.randint` from grouped data.
- All plots are generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Run

1. Open `Population_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Run all cells to generate visualizations.
3. Save or modify plots as needed.
